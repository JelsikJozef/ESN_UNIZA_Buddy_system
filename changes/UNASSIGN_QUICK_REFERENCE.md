### 💡 Tip 2: Use Export Screen for Overview
If you need to see all assignments at once, use Export screen.

### 💡 Tip 3: Match Score Helps
In Export screen, match score (e.g., 8/10) helps you decide if reassignment would improve matching.

### 💡 Tip 4: No Permanent Decisions
You can always unassign and try again. No data is lost.
